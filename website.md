# Draft of criticalmedia.group
Scott has bought the domain name [criticalmedia.group](https://criticalmedia.group). It sounds a bit like a consulting firm, but Scott and Jacob thought everything else seemed too long (e.g. criticalmediaformsworkinggroup.com).

Here you'll find a rough draft of the content that will go on our website. Please either email Scott or the whole list with concerns, suggestions, criticisms, improvements. (Or, if you have a Github account, file an issue.)
