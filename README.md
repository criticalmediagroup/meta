Here you'll find all-things process-related.

### What to look at:

[Questions we have](questions.md)

Some answers to some questions:

## Why "Critical Media Forms"?
Because Jacob and Scott thought it sounded productively vague, and that it could capture both "traditional" humanistic work and forms of making that tend to fall under the "DH" category. Also: because we needed an institution to sponsor an event, so we invented one. We're thinking explicitly of the "Sexual Politics/Sexual Poetics" group that many of our friends participate in. This seemed like a plausible institution. Please tell us otherwise if you think otherwise.

## Why "Seminar on Media Aesthetics"?
Because Scott has been mildly obsessed with that term for a long time (cf. the SLSA book launch with Patrick Jagoda and Stephanie Boluk and Patrick LeMieux called "Three New Books in Media Aesthetics"). But also because this really does describe the orientation of all of our work, as Scott understands it.

## Why November 2–5 for our first seminar?
Jacob and Scott agree that it's the best weekend, based on the survey Scott collected. That means *almost* everybody can make it.

## Why the website? Isn't that overblown?
Well, based on Scott's experiences with the *extremely* paranoid practices that Wayne State employs for research trip reimbursement, we figured it was best to cross our eyes and dot our tees. We'll be furnishing letters of invitation, receipts for any shared expenses (i.e. "registration fees", most likely related to transportation and food), and formal programs. We'll build out the infrastructure this year, and we should be able to recycle it for years to come.

## Why Github?
Because free hosting! And also because it actually is a great tool for collaboration. That said, we have no need to actually use any of its collaboration tools; it's plausible only as a hosting backend. We can discuss how we can use these tools.

## How can I make a criticism/critique/complaint?
If you have thoughts that run something like, "I have a problem with x, let's please do y instead; here are the reasons...", please do share. The easiest way to share is the email list, but if you have (or want to sign up for) a GitHub account, please open an issue. (Also, let Scott know so he can add you as a member of the group.)

## Why the "seminar" format?
In the survey Scott ran, this was the clear consensus candidate for a format. The idea is that people will submit work a month ahead of time (an essay or a book chapter—but please not a *forever long* book chapter), folks will read it, and then we'll have 90 minutes to discuss it.

## Do I have to present?
No. But all participants are obligated to read everything everybody has submitted in advance of the seminar.

## If we're having a group with members and all that, what are we going to do with it?
We will hopefully discuss this rather at length at the seminar.

## Why are there so many Patricks? And why are their last names alphabetically contiguous?
The universe is a strange place.
